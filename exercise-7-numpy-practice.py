"""Start up Python (best to use Spyder) and use it to answer the following questions. Use the following imports:import numpy as npimport scipy.linalg as laimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt1   Choose a value and set the variable x to that value.2   What is command to compute the square of x? Its cube?3   Choose an angle θ and set the variable theta to its value (a number).4   What is sinθ? cosθ? Angles can be measured in degrees or radians.    Which of these are being used used?5   Use the np.linspace function to create a row vector called meshPoints    containing exactly 500 values with values evenly spaced between -1 and 1.6   What expression will yield the value of the 53th element of meshPoints?    What is this value?7   Produce a plot of a sinusoid on the interval [−1, 1]    using the command plt.plot(meshPoints,np.sin(2*pi*meshPoints))8   Please save this plot as a jpeg (.jpg) file and send it along with your work."""import mathimport numpy as npimport scipy.linalg as laimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltLINE = "-" * 30# 1x = 42# 2print("Square of {x} is {square}, Cube is {cube}".format(x=x, square=x ** 2, cube=x ** 3))print(LINE)# 3theta = 30 * (math.pi / 180)# 4print("θ = {} radian, Sin of θ = {}, Cos of θ = {}".format(theta, math.sin(theta), math.cos(theta)))# print("θ = {} radian, Sin of θ = {}, Cos of θ = {}".format(theta, np.sin(theta), np.cos(theta)))print(LINE)# 5meshPoints = np.linspace(-1, 1, 500)print("500 values with values evenly spaced between -1 and 1\n", meshPoints)print(LINE)# 6print("53th value of meshPoints is {}".format(meshPoints[52]))print(LINE)# 7plt.plot(meshPoints, np.sin(2 * math.pi * meshPoints))plt.show()# 8plt.savefig("sin.png")
